This is the path to your custom song(would hopefully be in your custom songs folder in Beat Saber).&#xA;&#xA;Then choose your output path. This should probably be your custom songs folder(not the previous folder but one level up, the generic custom songs folder), but if you want to save it elsewhere first before migrating it to your custom songs folder that's fine as well.&#xA;&#xA;Then choose your difficulty level. After doing these three the other controls will become enabled.&#xA;&#xA;The other controls are fairly self explanatory outside of the cuts I suppose. Start will start the .ogg(audio) file from the custom song folder. Pause will pause it. Reset will take it back to the beginning(and clear out all sections you have created).&#xA;&#xA;As for the cuts, this is where we actually create the sections. Start the song, and as the song plays click the cut button to create a section from the previous cut's end to the current timestamp in the song. When you are finished creating your sections click the Create Sections button to create your sections in your output folder. They will be labeled with the numbers in the order that you cut them along with the section name you gave them.&#xA;&#xA;I'm aware that it's inconvenient that you can't just drag the slider in order to get to a part of the song you wish to go to. Currently you have to wait for the song to get there. This is because of the library I'm using is not working properly(or I'm misunderstanding something). Basically what's happening right now is that when you drag the slider to a specific point, and try to set the audio's time to the point the slider was dragged to in the code, it gets out of sync. The further along in the song it goes the more out of sync it gets. At first I thought it was an issue with consistent offset, that if I found a key value to offset the song by(with a little bit of extra math) I would be okay. I found that value for TTFAF, but when I tried it with other songs they went out of sync still, so the delay/offset/sync issue is inconsistent across the board."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="It was actually quite difficult to get the .ogg file to play, everything else was fairly easy, but I basically had to create an audio player in order to do this since there aren't any built in windows tools for .ogg files."/></TextBlock>
